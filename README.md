# EOSC211_Lab4
This is a part of the labs in Earth and Ocean Science 211 course at UBC.<br>
Lab 4 produces a figure with two subplots for pressure press = 90000 Pa:<br>
* the upper showing mixing ratio as a function of temperature (in Celsius) for RH(Relative Humidity) = 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90%.<br>
* the lower showing density as a function of temperature (in Celsius) for the same range of RH.<br>
